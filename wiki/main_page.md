* Hopefully google will index the page soon-ish
* Probably want to add to webmaster tools

## Todo 
  * https://www.toptal.com/github/unlimited-scale-web-hosting-github-pages-cloudflare
  
* Storage limit for Github repo is 1GB, should be manageable for my uses for quite a while. Gitlab is 10GB, but not sure if they support Jekyll functionality as well as Github.
  * https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/


## Done
  * Sitemap: https://nolanhergert.github.io/wiki-test/sitemap.xml
